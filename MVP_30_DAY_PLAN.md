## 💡 **MVP Value Proposition**

**"Connect your database, get instant REST + GraphQL APIs. European-hosted, GDPR-compliant, no vendor lock-in."**

### **Core User Flow (5 minutes):**
1. **Sign up** → Verify email → Dashboard
2. **Connect database** → Test connection → Import schema  
3. **Generate APIs** → View endpoints → Test in playground
4. **Use APIs** → Copy endpoints → Build your app

### **Key Differentiators:**
- **European Data Sovereignty** (vs US-based competitors)
- **Multi-Database Support** (PostgreSQL + MySQL vs Supabase PostgreSQL-only)
- **No Vendor Lock-in** (self-host option vs proprietary platforms)
- **5-Minute Setup** (vs weeks of custom API development)
